# Redux Examples

This repository is a series of examples of using Redux for demonstration purposes. It was written to outline how Redux works.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone` this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` in one terminal window, and `npm run serve` in another (uses python's `SimpleHTTPServer`)


## What to talk about

* Using redux without react
* Implementing `createStore` with vanilla JS
* Using redux with react (simply, without `connect` or the `react-redux` bindings)
* Using react-redux (react-connected)
* Using redux with thunks and promises (react-async)
* Some high-level project architecture decisions
* The redux dev tools
