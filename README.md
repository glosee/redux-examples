# Redux Examples

This repository is a series of examples of using Redux for demonstration purposes. It was written to outline how Redux works.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone` this repository
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build` in one terminal window, and `npm run serve` in another (uses python's `SimpleHTTPServer`)

## What to talk about

* Using redux without react
* Implementing `createStore` with vanilla JS
* Using redux with react (simply, without `connect` or the `react-redux` bindings)
* Using react-redux (react-connected)
* Using redux with thunks and promises (react-async)
* Some high-level project architecture decisions
* The redux dev tools

## TODO

* Example with `react-redux`
* Example with async actions
* Finish deck
* write blog post about it!

## Flow
* Have multiples of the project open in atom for every example, with only the files that you want to show for that example open!
* Show code examples in a series of files in atom
* Show deck
** talk about "the gist"
** talk about differences with flux
** show some ES6 examples
** talk about some terms
* Show vanilla JS example
* Implement `createStore` quickly
* Show react-simple example
* Show react-advanced example
* Implement `RESET` action to show how easy it is to keep adding
* Show `react-advanced-pro` example (if there's time/if you can do it)
